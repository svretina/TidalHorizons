var((x,y,z)) gives the values at x,y,z coordinates

-> get Gauss-Legendre grid in spherical coordinates
-> trasform the grid into cartesian coorinates
-> feed it into the interpolator of the respective
   grid function and get values
   this will basically serve as Func(r, theta , phi)
-> take these values and decompose them into spherical harm
-> get components



GaussLegendreGrid(θ, φ) -> (?) Cartesian grid -> GridFunction((x,y,z))

from horizon grid -> get (r, θ, φ) -> interpolate r(θ, φ)
in order to get new r' for θ', φ' Gauss legendre grid.

take r', θ', φ' --> Cartesian Grid --> GridFunction((x', y', z'))
